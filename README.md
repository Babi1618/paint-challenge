Welcome to my new little paint game! 

you can see the production deploy here: 
https://main--paint-challenge.netlify.app/

Here the rules of the challenge: 
The web app allows you to choose a color and draw on the canvas by holding down the mouse. When we stop pressing the mouse, it stops drawing. We can of course change color several times. In the navbar there are two numeric inputs that allow you to change the width and height of the drawn pixel. There is also a reset button that allows you to restore the canvas to the starting point.

Hope you enjoy!
